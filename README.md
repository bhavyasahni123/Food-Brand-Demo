# Cloud Kitchen Brands Website 🌐🍴

This is an open-source project for a **cloud kitchen management company's** website, designed to showcase and manage multiple sub-brands (each offering different cuisines or dining themes). The project is built with modular HTML structure, CSS/JS assets, and a focus on scalability and experimentation.
